## .dotfiles

Dotfiles are the system files that control how the system behaves and presents information. These files are tuned specifically to my personal preferences. However, anyone can use them as a starting point for their own customized system.

## Installation

Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/phmullins/dotfiles.git`), cd into the  appropriate folder, and then run the installation script for your OS. The script(s) will take care of sourcing the system files for you. There's no need to manually source anything or restart the terminal for changes to take effect.

- `./install_debian.sh`
- `./install_macOS.sh`
- `./install_raspbian.sh`
