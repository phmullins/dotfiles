## .dotfiles

Dotfiles are the system files that control how the system behaves and presents information. These files are tuned specifically to my personal preferences. However, anyone can use them as a starting point for their own customized system.

## Installation

Clone the repo and then run the `install.sh` script. Next, source `~/.bash_profile`, or restart the terminal for changes to take effect.
